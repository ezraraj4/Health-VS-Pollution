These 2 files (AsthmaVsPollution and MentalHealthVsPollution) both cive into how polltuion and the weather can affect a persons overall health while coming but with steps to solve problems at hand.

AsthmaVsPollution investigates the impact of air pollutants (PM2.5, NO2, CO, O3) on respiratory diseases—focusing particularly on asthma. The goal is to understand pollutant patterns, explore seasonal trends via time-series analysis, and build regression models to predict asthma-related hospitalizations or case numbers.

Key Components:

Data Loading & Cleaning:
Imports multiple datasets (pollution, city/state asthma rankings, temperature data) and performs necessary cleaning steps such as converting data types and handling missing values.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Uses statistical summaries and visualizations (histograms, line plots) to explore the distributions of pollutant levels and detect seasonal trends.

Time-Series Analysis:
Aggregates data on a monthly basis and applies seasonal decomposition techniques to identify recurring patterns and trends over time.

Data Merging:
Integrates pollution data with city and state asthma datasets (and temperature data) to create a unified view for further analysis.

Correlation & Regression Modeling:
Assesses the relationship between pollutant concentrations and asthma rates through correlation matrices and heatmaps. Builds a linear regression model to predict asthma outcomes based on environmental factors.

Actionable Recommendations:
Provides practical insights and recommendations for monitoring air quality, preparing for seasonal variations, and implementing urban policies to improve asthma outcomes.

MentalHealthVsPollution explores the link between air pollution and mental health indicators such as depression and anxiety. It also examines the role of seasonal or temperature-related trends in influencing mental health outcomes, aiming to predict metrics like AMI_percent through regression analysis.

Key Components:

Data Integration & Standardization:
Loads datasets on air pollution, state-level mental health statistics, and temperature. Standardizes key variables (e.g., state names) to ensure consistency across all data sources.

Merging Datasets:
Combines pollution data (aggregated by state) with mental health and temperature records to enable a comprehensive, multi-faceted analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Performs correlation analysis to examine relationships between pollution levels, temperature, and mental health indicators. Uses visualizations such as heatmaps and line plots to showcase seasonal trends.

Regression Modeling:
Develops both linear regression and Random Forest regression models to predict mental health metrics based on environmental factors. Evaluates model performance using metrics like mean squared error (MSE) and R².

Feature Importance & Residual Analysis:
Identifies the most influential predictors through feature importance rankings and performs residual analysis to assess model performance.

Actionable Recommendations:
Offers insights on air quality monitoring, seasonal preparedness, policy interventions, and potential next steps (such as integrating additional data sources and advanced ML techniques) to improve mental health outcomes.
